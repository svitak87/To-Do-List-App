About This Application

This Full Stack Application is built using the Postgres database for data storage, Express.js for the backend server, React for the frontend user interface, and Node.js for server-side runtime environment. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each component:

Postgres:
Postgres is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and robust feature set. It's used in this application to store and manage structured data efficiently.

Express.js:
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. In this application, Express.js is utilized to create a RESTful API to handle client requests, interact with the database, and manage routing.

React:
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of their applications. In this application, React is used to build the frontend interface, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

Node.js:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's designed to build scalable network applications and is commonly used for server-side development. In this application, Node.js serves as the backend runtime environment, allowing JavaScript to be executed server-side.

Key Features:

Database Management: Utilizes Postgres for efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.
RESTful API: Implements an Express.js server to handle client requests and interact with the database through RESTful endpoints.
User Interface: Utilizes React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface, enhancing the user experience.
Server Runtime: Utilizes Node.js to provide a robust server-side runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
